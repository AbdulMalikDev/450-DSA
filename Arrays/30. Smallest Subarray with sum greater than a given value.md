## Explanation :

**NAIVE**

- A S**imple solution**

    is to use two nested loops. The outer loop picks a starting element, the inner loop considers all elements (on right side of current start) as ending element. Whenever sum of elements between current start and end becomes more than the given number, update the result if current length is smaller than the smallest length so far.

OPTIMIZED

- There is an idea if all the elements of the array are positive. If a subarray has sum greater than the given sum then there is no possibility that adding elements to the current subarray the sum will be x (given sum). Idea is to use a similar approach to a sliding window. Start with an empty subarray, add elements to the subarray until the sum is less than x. If the sum is greater than x, remove elements from the start of the current subarray.

## Code :

```python
nums = [1, 4, 45, 6, 10, 19]
k = 51
# find shortest sub-array with sum greater than k
def fun(nums,k):

   currSum = 0
   minLength = len(nums) + 1
   start = 0
   end = 0

   while end < len(nums):
      
      while currSum <= k and end < len(nums):
         currSum += nums[end]
         end += 1
      
      while currSum > k and start < len(nums):
         if (end - start) < minLength:
            minLength = end - start
         
         currSum -= nums[start]
         start += 1

   return minLength

print(fun(nums,k))
```
