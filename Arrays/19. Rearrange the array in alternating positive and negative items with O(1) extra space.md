# *Problem Statement :*

Given an array of positive and negative numbers, arrange them in an alternate fashion such that every positive number is followed by negative and vice-versa maintaining the order of appearance.

Number of positive and negative numbers need not be equal. If there are more positive numbers they appear at the end of the array. If there are more negative numbers, they too appear in the end of the array.

## Explanation :

The above problem can be easily solved if O(n) extra space is allowed. It becomes interesting due to the limitations that O(1) extra space and order of appearances.

The idea is to process array from left to right. While processing, find the first out of place element in the remaining unprocessed array. An element is out of place if it is negative and at odd index, or it is positive and at even index. Once we find an out of place element, we find the first element after it with opposite sign. We right rotate the subarray between these two elements (including these two).

> The reason we are not just simply swapping and actually right rotating is that, we want the elements which are leftover to shift to the end of the array, swapping does not ensure that.

## Code :

```python

nums = [-5, -2, 5, 2, 4, 7, 1, 8, 0, -8]

def fun(nums):
   isoutofplace = False
   outOfPlaceIdx = -1

   def isOutOfPlace(index,num):
      # Logic for out of place
      if (index + 1) % 2 != 0 :
         if num > 0:
            return True
         else:
            return False
      else:
         if num < 0:
            return True
         else:
            return False

   def getNextOppSignNum(index,nums):
      for i in range(index+1 , len(nums)):
         if nums[index] > 0 and nums[i] < 0:
            return i
         elif nums[index] < 0 and nums[i] > 0:
            return i
         else:
            continue
      return -1

   def rightRotateArray(outOfPlaceIdx,oppSignIdx,nums):
      firstNum = nums[oppSignIdx]
      prev = nums[outOfPlaceIdx]
      for i in range(outOfPlaceIdx,oppSignIdx):
         temp = nums[i+1]
         nums[i+1] = prev
         prev = temp
      nums[outOfPlaceIdx] = firstNum
      return nums 

   for index,num in enumerate(nums):

      isoutofplace = isOutOfPlace(index,num)

      if isoutofplace:
         outOfPlaceIdx = index
         oppSignIdx = getNextOppSignNum(index,nums)
         print("out of place index is : " + str(outOfPlaceIdx))
         print("Opp sign index is : " + str(oppSignIdx))

         if oppSignIdx == -1:
            continue
         
         #right rotate array between these two indices
         nums = rightRotateArray(outOfPlaceIdx,oppSignIdx,nums)

   return nums

print(fun(nums))
```

## Time Space Complexity :

O ( N ^ 2 ) TIME | O ( 1 ) SPACE
