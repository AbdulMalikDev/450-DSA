# *Solution  :*

## Explanation :

A **simple solution** is to consider all subarrays one by one and check the sum of every subarray. We can run two loops: the outer loop picks a starting point i and the inner loop tries all subarrays starting from i (See **[this](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-subarray-with-given-sum/)** for implementation). Time complexity of this method is O(n2).

We can also **use hashing**. The idea is to iterate through the array and for every element arr[i], calculate sum of elements form 0 to i (this can simply be done as sum += arr[i]). If the current sum has been seen before, then there is a zero sum array. Hashing is used to store the sum values, so that we can quickly store sum and find out whether the current sum is seen before or not.

## Code :

```python
import sys
from collections import Counter
nums = [4,2,0,1,6]

def subArrWithZeroSum(nums):
   sumSoFar = 0
   sums = {}

   for index,num in enumerate(nums):
      sumSoFar += num
      sums[index] = sumSoFar
   
   duplicates = [ k for k,v in Counter(sums.values()).items() if v > 1 ]

   if len(duplicates):
      return True
   return False

print("There exists subarray with sum zero : ")
print(subArrWithZeroSum(nums))
```

## Time Space Complexity :

O ( N ) TIME | O ( N ) SPACE
