Given an array **arr[]** denoting heights of **N** towers and a positive integer **K** , you have to modify the height of each tower either by increasing or decreasing them by **K**

only once. After modifying, height should be a **non-negative** integer.

Find out what could be the possible minimum difference of the height of shortest and longest towers after you have modified each tower.

# *Solution  1 (Recursion):*

## Explanation :

Find all possible permutations of the array by subtracting and adding all of them using recursion and pull out the minimum one.

## Code :

```python
import sys
inputNums = [1,5,8,10] 
k = 4
def minDiff(nums,i,k):

    # when list completed return difference
    if i == len(inputNums):
        return max(nums) - min(nums)

    # add and subtract k
    addedNum = inputNums[i] + k 
    subtractedNum = inputNums[i] - k

    result1 = sys.maxsize
    result2 = sys.maxsize

    # if positive add to list and recurse farther

    if  addedNum > 0:
        addedList = nums.copy()
        addedList[i] = addedNum
        result1 = minDiff(addedList,i+1,k)

    if subtractedNum > 0:
        subList = nums.copy()
        subList[i] = subtractedNum
        result2 = minDiff(subList,i+1,k)

    # return the minimum of both results to obtain minimum overall
    return min(result1,result2)

print("Minimum Difference")
print(minDiff(inputNums.copy(),0,k))
```

## Time Space Complexity :

O ( 2 ^ N ) TIME 

# *Solution 2 (Greedy) :*

## Code :

```python
import sys
inputNums = [1,5,15,10] 
k = 3
def minDiff(nums,k):

   # sort array
   nums.sort()

   # after sorting initialize default small, ans and big values
   small = nums[0] + k
   big = nums[len(nums)-1] - k
   ans = sys.maxsize
   n = len(nums)

   if(small > big):
      small , big =  big , small

   for i in range(1,n-1):
      add = nums[i] + k
      subtract = nums[i] - k

      # Since the problem says we NEED to either subtract or add
      # so we don't have option to leave it as it is.

      # If we can 'fit' the number in the sequence without disturbing
      # original difference, skip it
      if(subtract >= small or add <= big):
         continue

      # if we HAVE to either subtract or add, and we cannot ignore or fit it,
      # we choose the minimum out of both. This is called greedy method

      difference1 = big - subtract
      difference2 = add - small

      if(difference1 < difference2):
         small = subtract
      else:
         big = add

   return min(ans,big-small)

print("Minimum Difference")
print(minDiff(inputNums,k))
```

## Time Space Complexity :

O ( N * LOGN ) TIME

since we are sorting array
