# *Problem Statement :*

Given an array (or string), the task is to reverse the array/string

Given an array and a range [**lowVal**, **highVal**], partition the array around the range such that array is divided in three parts.1) All elements smaller than **lowVal** come first.2) All elements in range **lowVal** to **highVVal** come next.3) All elements greater than **highVVal** appear in the end.The individual elements of three sets can appear in any order.

**Examples:**

```
Input: arr[] = {1, 14, 5, 20, 4, 2, 54, 20, 87, 98, 3, 1, 32}  
        lowVal = 14, highVal = 20
Output: arr[] = {1, 5, 4, 2, 1, 3, 14, 20, 20, 98, 87, 32, 54}

Input: arr[] = {1, 14, 5, 20, 4, 2, 54, 20, 87, 98, 3, 1, 32}  
       lowVal = 20, highVal = 20       
Output: arr[] = {1, 14, 5, 4, 2, 1, 3, 20, 20, 98, 87, 32, 54} 
```

# *Solution  :*

## Explanation :

A **simple solution** is to sort the array. This solution does a lot of extra rearrangements and requires O(n Log n) time.

An **efficient solution** is based on **[Dutch National Flag based QuickSort](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/3-way-quicksort-dutch-national-flag/)**. We traverse given array elements from left. We keep track of two pointers, first (called start in below code) to store next position of smaller element (smaller than range) from beginning; and second (called end in below code) to store next position of greater element from end.

## Code :

```cpp
# Python3 program to implement three way 
# partitioning around a given range. 

# Partitions arr[0..n-1] around [lowVal..highVal] 
def threeWayPartition(arr, n, lowVal, highVal): 

	# Initialize ext available positions for 
	# smaller (than range) and greater lements 
	start = 0
	end = n - 1
	i = 0

	# Traverse elements from left 
	while i <= end: 

		# If current element is smaller than 
		# range, put it on next available smaller 
		# position. 
		if arr[i] < lowVal: 
			temp = arr[i] 
			arr[i] = arr[start] 
			arr[start] = temp 
			i += 1
			start += 1

		# If current element is greater than 
		# range, put it on next available greater 
		# position. 
		elif arr[i] > highVal: 
			temp = arr[i] 
			arr[i] = arr[end] 
			arr[end] = temp 
			end -= 1

		else: 
			i += 1

# Driver code 
if __name__ == "__main__": 
	arr = [1, 14, 5, 20, 4, 2, 54, 
		20, 87, 98, 3, 1, 32] 
	n = len(arr) 

	threeWayPartition(arr, n, 10, 20) 

	print("Modified array") 
	for i in range(n): 
		print(arr[i], end = " ")
